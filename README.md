## Course Description
In this hands-on course, Troy Miles—an award-winning software engineer, speaker, and author—explores the powerful combination of Ktor and Kotlin Multiplatform to build full-stack applications that share code across platforms. Step through the full process of creating a data-rich server application with Ktor, deploying it to AWS, and building cross-platform mobile clients using Kotlin Multiplatform with Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS. Learn advanced techniques for handling large datasets, implementing API security, and creating efficient mobile UIs that communicate seamlessly with your backend. Plus, explore best practices for the security and performance of your applications.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop-up menu in GitHub to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code.

When switching from one exercise file branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
